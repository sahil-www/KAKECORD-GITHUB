This is a discord based gaming bot that I developed as a learner's project. And for that reason, everything in this project is built from scratch and works independently of all module
other than discord.py, some postgres helped modules and python standard libraries.
It supports player-player games, bot-player games, and a credit system to store user's points.
The user interface is also neatlly developed and navigating through the bot is really easy and simple for new players as well as old ones.
